Welcome! This page explains how to write a guide and submit it as a GitHub pull request.

## Before you start

- Guides live in `site/src/content/docs/guides/`.
- Write guides in Markdown or MDX (`.md` or `.mdx`).
- Include frontmatter at the top with `title` and `description`.

### Quick template

```md
---
title: Your Guide Title
description: One-line summary of what readers will learn.
---

## Introduction

Explain the context and the goal.

## Steps

1. Step one...
2. Step two...

## Examples

Show a minimal, working example.

## Further reading

Link to related classes, reference pages, or external resources.
```

## Submit via GitHub UI (no local setup)

1. Open the guides folder on GitHub: [`site/src/content/docs/guides`](https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/lol-meta-wiki/tree/main/site/src/content/docs/guides)
2. Click “Add file” → “Create new file”.
3. Name it like `my-guide-name.md`.
4. Paste the template above and write your content.
5. Commit changes and open a Pull Request.

Once merged, your guide will automatically appear under the **Guides** section in the sidebar.

## Submit locally (for larger edits)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/lol-meta-wiki.git
cd lol-meta-wiki
pnpm install

# Create your guide
$EDITOR site/src/content/docs/guides/my-guide-name.md

# Preview the site
pnpm generate-db
pnpm dev
```

Open a PR when you're ready. The site is built with Astro + Starlight and will show an “Edit this page” link on docs pages for quick fixes.

## Style tips

- Prefer short sections and concrete examples.
- Link to classes (under `/classes/`) and reference pages when relevant.
- Keep titles descriptive and use the `description` to set expectations.
